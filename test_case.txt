Using password
1. Get the target host's IP address
2. Try to log in to the target host using your username and host's IP (i.e., ssh <user>@<host>)
3. If prompted for password, it means port 22 is working and SSH connection can be established
4. Log in to the target host using your username and password to confirm successful connection

Using key
1. Get the target host's IP address
2. Generate SSH public and private key pair using ssh-keygen
3. Copy public key to target host using ssh-copy-id
4. If copy is successful (i.e., "echo $?" returns "0"), SSH connection can be established
5. Log in to the target host (i.e., ssh <user>@<host>) to confirm successful connection
